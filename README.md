## Project Description
As coursework for the Simulation and Modelling exam, my team built a Game Theory simulation which replicates and expands the work of Abari and White (2009), taking advantage of the Agent Based Modelling methodology.

Using the Mesa library in Python, we created several agents and examined the outcomes of their interactions.
Each agents has a set of decision rules, which leads it to cooperate or defect in transactions with others, taking place in a game-theory setting.
